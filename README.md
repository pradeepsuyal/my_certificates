Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

Data Science gives meaning to raw data and converts it into meaningful insights that can be used to grow the business and recognize market trends. With so less supply of specialized Data Scientists and a rapid demand, Data Science has become a lucrative career.

`After completing this course I got a very deep understanding of data science and machine learning.
Now I wanted to get even deeper understanding of mathematical intuition so I opted for:`

### 365 DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM
------------------------

*The program covered:*

1.Introduction to Data and Data Science :

Introducing you to the field of data science and building your understanding of the key data science terms and processes.

2.Statistics :

Covering descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as hypothesis testing techniques and exercises, statistics puts the “scientist” in data scientist.

3.Probability :

Teaching you the probability theory necessary to think like a data scientist. You will learn about expected values, combinatorics, Bayesian notation, and probability distributions.

4.Python Programmer Bootcamp :

Developing your programming skills in Python and teaching you how to solve problems by thinking computationally.

5.Mathematics :

Teaching you the linear algebra you need for the true data science expertise of developing powerful machine learning models.

6.SQL :

Equipping you with the essential data science skills to effectively manage relational databases by extracting, transforming, and loading your data.

7.Machine Learning in Python :

Sharpening your predictive modelling skills to differentiate you as a data scientist instead of a data analyst; covering regressions, classifications, and clustering.

8.Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 :

Helping you learn and practice advanced deep learning techniques with TensorFlow 2.0 code and syntax. Complete with new TF2 exercises and projects.

9.Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow in Python :

Introducing you to the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and computer vision. We will learn about what makes CNNs tick, discuss some effective techniques to improve their performance,

10.Introduction to Tableau :

Teaching you how to tell compelling stories with data by building accessible visualization and dashboards. With these skills, you will be able to present complicated results in a comprehensive way to non--technical audiences.

### MACHINE LEARNING BY STANFORD UNIVERSITY
-------------------------------------------

About this Course
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
